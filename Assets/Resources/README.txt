GRAPHIC LICENSE

The day and night images of the earth are from NASA's "Blue Marble 2002" image
collection:
http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_set.php?categoryID=2364

The night image has been altered to better match by overlaying, blending, and color-matching missing ice from the day image.  These modifications are not considered to be substantial, and are therefore ineligible for copyright.

NASA Terms of Use

For all non-private uses, NASA's Terms Of Use are as follows:

   1. The imagery is free of licensing fees
   2. NASA requires that they be provided a credit as the owners of the imagery

Visible Earth Addendum

Beyond the NASA Terms, the Visible Earth team requests, but does not require:

   1. The Visible Earth be provided a credit as the location that the imagery was found at
   2. A URL be provided, either to the Visible Earth
      (http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/) or to the page providing the link to the used image.

FONT LICENSES
The boxy font used is "Acknowledge", by Brian Kent, modified in order to have 
the numbers fixed-width and to register the correct height in pygame.
