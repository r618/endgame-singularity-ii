endgame-singularity-ii
======================

Unity remake of the Endgame:Singularity game http://www.emhsoft.com/singularity/

Heads up: it's not a very good port - Unity is/was not very well suited for such UI heavy game
Using IMGUI the code is not very straightforward and atm still has some (very) few bugs, unfortunately -
It also doesn't take any advantage/s of native/mobile platforms which would make sense - such as local notifications and/or running in the background

A direct python port of the original game would be much more welcome; leaving this here as mobile explosion era witness for future past internet archive.
